    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one these. After you make your
        choice you will get a new set of options; just what set os option you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is 
        repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made  good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if 
        you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree porbably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that 
        the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its 
        children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suppose you get to abad leaf. You can bacKtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice,
        and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try
        another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no option left, there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>
    <img src="./Image_root.png"/>
    <br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D.You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example we draw a pictuire of a tree. The tree is abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could
        make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we
        have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)

    <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
    
        <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n) {
                if n is a leaf node{
                    if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                    else return false
                }else {
                    for each child c of n {
                        if solve(c) suceeds, return true
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }
        </pre>
        </font>
    
    <p>
        Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If 
        solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on apath from the root to some
        goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
    </p>
    <h4>How does this work?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable(part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any
        child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines
    </p>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            for each child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            }
            retuen false
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal
        node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines
    </p>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            }
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>To search a tree:</b></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is goal node</li>
        <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
    <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact,
        that is how your recursive algorithm are translated into machine or assembly language.
    </p>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n) {
                put node n on the stack;
                while the stack is not empty {
                    if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
                        if it is a goal node, return true
                        else pop it off the stack
                    }
                    else{
                        if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                            push the next untried child onto the stack
                        else pop the node off the stack

                    }
                   return false 
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>
        Starting from the root, the only nodes that can b pushed onto the stack are the children of the nodes currently on the top of the stack, and these
        are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when
        it is konown that they have no goal nodes among their desceendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no 
        goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack from (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, 
        the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or strong it in an array.
    </p>
    <P>
        Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:
    </P>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n) {
                if n is a leaf node {
                    if the leaf is goal node {
                        print n
                        return true
                    }
                        else return false
                }else {
                 for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds {
                        print n
                        return true
                    }
                 }
                 return false
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </font>
    <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
    <p>
        All of these versions of the backttracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real preoblem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
    </p>
    <p>
        for example, if the path represents a series of moves in chess problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solution
    </p>
    <p>
        To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in a chessgame, for example, you could tests
        whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it <b>isLeaf.</b>) This method would encapsulate all the
        ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have
        been tried already (so we don't have to try them again.) In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <b>for each child c of n.</b> In reality , it may be difficult to figure
        out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them.
        In the chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can
        represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?
    </p>
    <p>
        The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows:
        As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure". This is a simple appreoach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried
        <b>child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children <b>k+1</b> through <b>n.</b>
        Or, if you are trying to color a map with just try <b>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow fails,
        you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straing, right <b>(or perhaps north, east, south,west).</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It isn't always easy to find a node. <b>In the chess game example,</b> you might number yourpieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several
        moves, and these must also be ordered.
    </p><br>
    <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
    <p>
        For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the 
        simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child.
        All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not 
        part of the definition of a binary tree. The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a definition of the BinaryTress class:
    </p>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            public class BinaryTree {
                BinaryTree leftChild = null;
                BinaryTree rightChild = null;
                boolean isGoalNode = false;
                String name;

                BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
                    this.name = name;
                    leftChild = left;
                    rightChild = right;
                    this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
                }
            }
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>
        Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which construct the above binary tree.
    </p>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            static BinaryTree makeTree() {
                BinaryTree root , a, b, c, d, e, f;
                c = new BinaryTree("C",null, null, false);
                d = new BinaryTree("D",null, null, false);
                e = new BinaryTree("E",null, null, true);
                f = new BinaryTree("F",null, null, false);
                a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
                b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
                root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
                return root;
            }
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>
        Here's a main program to create a binary tree to solve it:
    </p>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            public static void main(String args[]){
                BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
                System.out.println(solvable(tree));
            }
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>
        And Finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary by finding a goal node.
    </p>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {

            /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false;
            
            /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
            
            /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
            
            /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
            
            /* 5 */ return false;
            
            }
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>
        Here's what the numbered lines are doing:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. this statement is so that we can this method with the children of a node, without
            first checking whether those children actually exist.
        </li>
        <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
        <li>See if the left child is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null
            and is not a goal node, says to
        </li>
        <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <li>Since neither child for the right child.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An
        alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:
    </p>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
            
                if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
            
            if (node.isleftChild !=null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
            
            if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
            
            return false;

            }
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>
        I think the first version is simpler, but second version is slightly more efficient.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What are the children?</h3>
    <p>
        one of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous
        choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next, as you know, both the left and the right child
        are possible solutions, in many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter
        how convoluted the countries are, can be colord with at most four colors, so that countries that share a border are the same color.
    </p>
    <p>
        To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two ways to do this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
        <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of
            countries, you have been successfully colored the map.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkboard. this should be asily solvable; agter all, a 
        checkboard only need two colors.
    </p>
    <p><b>boolean mapIsOK()</b><br>
        Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
    </p>
    <p><b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b><br>
        Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</b><br>
        Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkboard).
    </p>
    <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            bolean explore(int row, int column, int color) {
             if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOL();
             map[row][column] = color;
             for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;

             }
             return false;
            }
        </pre>
    </font>
    <font color="blue">
    <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
    <pre>
        boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {
         
         if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return true;

         if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {

            map[row][column] = color;

            for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {

                int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);

                if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
            }
         }   

         return false;

        }
    </pre>
    </font>
    <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</p>
    <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>2 by 3 map</td>
            <td>3 by 3 map</td>
            <td>3 by 4 map</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Method 1:</td>
            <td>60 ms.</td>
            <td>940 ms.</td>
            <td>60530 ms. (1 minute)</td>
        </tr> <tr>
            <td>Method 2:</td>
            <td>0 ms.</td>
            <td>0 ms.</td>
            <td>0 ms</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of
        these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will 
        often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check u
